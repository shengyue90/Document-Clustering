# Document-Clustering
Machine Learning – Document Clustering & Topic Modeling

• Designed an algorithm that clustered unlabeled text documents into groups and explored latent semantic structures using natural language tool kit for Python

• Preprocessed text documents by tokenizing, stemming and removing stopwords, and extracted features using TF-IDF approach

• Trained the data using unsupervised machine learning model K-Means Clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

• Identified latent topics and keywords of each document for clustering and calculated document similarity

• Visualized results by reducing dimension utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
